<p>The timer engine implementation package provides an
implementation of the {@link com.golden.gamedev.engine.BaseTimer}
interface. It contains two classes.</p>
<p>The first class, useable even without an actual timer, is {@link
com.golden.gamedev.engine.timer.FPSCounter}. This class is very easy to
use to calculate a running total of the frames per second displayed via
a game.</p>
<p>The second class, {@link
com.golden.gamedev.engine.timer.SystemTimer}, is an implementation of
the {@link com.golden.gamedev.engine.BaseTimer} interface that has a
built-in correction scheme for "time drift" due to {@link
java.lang.InterruptedException interrupted exceptions} occurring during
sleep. It uses {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis} to keep track
of time, and a {@link com.golden.gamedev.engine.timer.FPSCounter} to
keep track of the frames per second.</p>
